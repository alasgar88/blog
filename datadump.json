"tesla-tsla-shares-pop-on-record-delivery-numbers", "author": 1, "body": "Prices for shares of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) popped Monday morning after the electric car maker reported record delivery numbers for the third quarter over the weekend. The company said that it delivered 241,300 vehicles in the third quarter, an increase of 73% from same period last year.1 That figure also brings Tesla's total delivery numbers for this year to 627,000 vehicles, up 100% as compared to 2020 figures.\r\n\r\nAnalysts' consensus estimate for the company's numbers was between 220,000 and 225,000. Tesla's shares jumped by almost 4% from their closing price on Friday. As of this writing, they were changing hands at $803.21, an increase of 3.61% from Friday's price.\r\n\r\nA Pandemic Record \r\nTesla produced a total of 237,823 vehicles in the third quarter of 2021. Out of that figure, 228,882 vehicles were Model 3 or Model Y cars—its mid-range cars targeted at price-conscious customers. The company also produced 8,941 editions of its pricier best-seller sedans Model S and Model X.\r\n\r\nTesla's latest numbers continue a winning streak from last quarter, when it surpassed the 200,000-car delivery figure for the first time since it began reporting earnings. Tesla's figures are even more impressive when you consider that they were achieved despite pandemic-induced supply chain bottlenecks and a chip shortage that has hamstrung operations in the car industry.\r\n\r\nDelivery numbers for General Motors Company (GM) in the United States were down by 33% to 446,997 vehicles in the third quarter. GM, which is the biggest car company by sales, blamed the chip shortage plaguing the car industry for its disappointing figures.2 Ford Motor Company (F) delivered 400,793 cars, a drop of 27.4% from last year,3 in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) reported sales of 566,005 cars, an increase of 1.4% from the same period last year. \r\n\r\nHowever, those figures may not be enough to offset an estimated overall decline of car sales to 12.4 million, the lowest since May 2020, based on data from Wards Intelligence.\r\nHow Did Tesla Achieve Its Record Figure? \r\nTesla benefited from a couple of factors. First, it has regulatory tailwinds to boost sales. In the United States, the Biden administration has tabled legislation to make electric cars cheaper and is planning to build infrastructure to support electric vehicles. Car prices rose during the pandemic due to an inventory crunch, and many customers put off purchase decisions. Tesla vehicles are already among the most heavily subsidized electric vehicles in China.\r\nAccording to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, Tesla also has a more efficient supply chain as compared to other car companies. The efficiency worked in favor of Tesla when it came to sourcing chips or coping with their shortage. Tesla CEO Elon Musk told analysts that the company had taken to writing its own firmware—software instructions used for communication between different machine parts. It also finished production of cars with missing parts, often adding them later. \"Ford and GM among others have very complex supply chain which put them in the eye of the storm,\" said Ives.4\r\nTesla's Shanghai factory, which began producing cars right before the pandemic, may have also played a role in boosting delivery numbers. It has been less affected by the chip shortage due to its proximity to chip suppliers in Asia, according to Ives. The facility makes Model 3s and Model Ys for markets in Europe and China. According to figures from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), the facility is on track to deliver 300,000 vehicles in the first nine months of this year.\r\nWhile Tesla has managed to weather the chip shortage this period, it might have more competition in the coming quarters. The supply chain situation is set to improve.\r\n\r\n\"As we look to the fourth quarter, a steady flow of vehicles held at plants will continue to be released to dealers, we are restarting production at key crossover and car plants, and we look forward to a more stable operating environment through the fall,\" Steve Carlisle, GM's executive vice president and president of North America, stated in a release.\r\nA hint of things to come might lie in Ford's release this morning, stating that it has already received more than 150,000 reservations for its electric pickup SUV. To that end, Tesla will have to gear up for more competition for customer dollars.\r\n\r\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\r\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

(ADP). The firm handles payroll for about a fifth of U.S. private employment, putting it in a unique position to survey trends in the nation’s labor market.\r\n\r\nADP collects data through the payroll services and benefits administration it provides to companies. It issues reports on its findings through a partnership with Moody’s Analytics.\r\nDetails of the ADP National Employment Report\r\nThe methodology of the ADP National Employment Report is managed by Moody’s Analytics. The report is divided into four separate releases, using figures that are seasonally adjusted. Each report provides the following information:\r\nA national snapshot showing the change in the number of nonfarm private payrolls, which also breaks that change down by the size of the business and industry.\r\nSmall businesses: Breaks the change in payrolls down by size (small and very small) and broad sector (goods-providing or services-providing).\r\nFranchises: Breaks changes in employment in that sector down by industry, such as restaurants, accommodations, and real estate.\r\nRegional assessment of employment trends, highlighting changes in six states (California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Florida, and Illinois), for which it provides sector and industry breakdowns.\r\n\r\nThe ADP National Employment Report is released two days prior to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment situation report, which is available on the first Friday of each month. Investors and economists see the ADP report as a preview of the more detailed and comprehensive government data release.\r\n\r\nExample of the ADP National Employment Report\r\nIn June 2021, private-sector employment increased by 692,000. That figure represents a mild decrease from the prior month, but it is still substantially lower than the job creation seen over the past six months.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of severe economic damage—the result of government restrictions on social distancing and keeping businesses open—Moody’s said the findings showed that the labor market is in a robust recovery. Payrolls were up by three million in the first half of the year but were still seven million jobs short of the pre-business lockdown levels.1\r\n\r\nSpecial Considerations\r\nThe number of people that are employed can tell us a lot about the state of the economy. Total employment and the rate of unemployment are used to determine when the economy is in a recession. The chart below illustrates non-farm private employment data since 2003.

This happens when the government is either unable or unwilling to make good on its fiscal promises to repay its bondholders. Argentina, Russia, and Lebanon are just a few of the governments that have defaulted over the past decades.\r\n\r\nOf course, not all defaults are the same. In some cases, the government misses an interest or principal payment. Other times, it merely delays a disbursement. The government can also exchange the original notes for new ones with less favorable terms. Here, the holder either accepts lower returns or takes a “haircut” on the loan – that is, accepts a bond with a much smaller par value.\r\n\r\nFactors Affecting Default Risk\r\nHistorically, failure to make good on loans is a bigger problem for countries that borrow in a foreign currency instead of using their own. Many developing countries issue bonds in an alternate currency in order to attract investors – often denominated U.S. dollars – but borrowing in another currency plays a significant role in default risk. The reason is that when a country that borrows foreign currency faces a budgetary shortfall, it does not have the option to print more money.\r\n\r\nThe nature of a country’s government also plays a major role in credit risk. Research suggests that the presence of checks and balances leads to fiscal policies that maximize social welfare – and honoring debt carried by domestic as well as foreign investors is a component of maximizing social welfare. Conversely, governments that are composed of certain political groups with a disproportionate power level can lead to reckless spending and, eventually, default.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102413/why-and-when-do-countries-default.asp#:~:text=With%20the%20ability,creating%20inflationary%20pressure.\r\nMitigating Risks\r\nWhen a country defaults on its debt, the impact on bondholders can be severe. In addition to punishing individual investors, defaulting impacts pension funds and other large investors with substantial holdings. One way that institutional investors can protect themselves against catastrophic losses is through a hedging strategy known as a credit default swap (CDS). With a CDS, the contract seller agrees to pay any remaining principal and interest on a debt should the nation go into default. In exchange, the buyer pays a period protection fee, which is similar to an insurance premium. The protected party agrees to transfer the original bond, which may have some residual value, to its counterpart should a negative credit event occur.\r\n\r\nWhile originally intended as a form of protection or insurance, swaps have also become a common way to speculate on a country's credit risk. Many of those trading CDS, in other words, do not have positions on the underlying bonds that they reference. For example, an investor who thinks the market has overestimated Greece's credit problems could sell a contract and collect premiums and be confident that there is no one to reimburse.\r\n\r\nBecause credit default swaps are relatively sophisticated instruments and trade over-the-counter (OTC), getting up-to-date market prices is difficult for typical investors. This is one of the reasons only institutional investors use them, as they come with more extensive market knowledge and access to special computer programs that capture transaction data.\r\nEconomic Impact\r\nJust as an individual who misses payments has a harder time finding affordable loans, countries that default – or risk default, for that matter – experience substantially higher borrowing costs. Ratings agencies such as Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch are responsible for evaluating the credit quality of countries worldwide based on their financial and political outlook. In general, nations with a higher credit rating enjoy lower interest rates and thus cheaper borrowing costs.\r\n\r\nWhen a country does default, it can take years to recover. Argentina, which missed bond payments beginning in 2001, is a perfect example. By 2012, the interest rate on its bonds was still more than 12 percentage points higher than that of U.S. Treasuries. If a country has defaulted even once, it becomes harder to borrow in the future, and so low-income countries are particularly at risk. According to Masood Ahmed, a former senior executive at the IMF and now president of the Center for Global Development, as of Oct. 2018, of the 59 of the countries that the IMF classifies as low-income developing countries, 24 were in a debt crisis or at the edge of one, which is almost 40% and double the number in 2013.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest concern about a default, however, is the impact on the broader economy. In the United States, for instance, many mortgages and student loans are pegged to Treasury rates. If borrowers were to experience dramatically higher payments as the result of a debt default, the result would be substantially less disposable income to spend on goods and services.\r\n\r\nBecause of fear of contagion can spread to other economies, countries with close ties – particularly those that own much of the country's debt – will sometimes step in to avert an outright default. This happened in the mid-1990s when the United States helped to bail out Mexican bonds. Another example in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis occurred as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Union (EU), and European Central Bank (ECB), came together to provide Greece with much-needed liquidity and credit stabilization.\r\n\r\nAfter Default: The Perfect Time to Invest?\r\nWhereas some investors look at a financial crisis and see chaos and losses, others recognize a crisis as a potential opportunity. These investors believe that sovereign default represents a bottoming out point – or something close to it – for government bonds. For the optimistic investor, the only logical direction for these bonds is up.\r\n\r\nA number of so-called “vulture funds” specialize in precisely this type of bond buying activity. Much like a debt collection agency buys personal credit accounts at a low cost, these funds purchase defaulted government bonds for a fraction of their original worth. Because of the broader economic fallout that follows a sovereign default, investors frequently seek to pick up undervalued stocks in that country as well.\r\n\r\nInvesting in defaulting countries comes with its fair share of risk, of course, because there is no guarantee that a rebound will ever take place, and the larger issues that caused the default in the first place may still persist or are yet to be fully worked out. Those seeking security in their portfolio above all else should probably invest elsewhere. However, recent historical examples are encouraging for the growth-oriented investor. For instance, within the past few decades, equity markets in Russia, Brazil, and Mexico increased substantially in the wake of a bond crisis. The key is to look for companies with competitive advantages and a low price-to-earnings ratio that reflects their elevated risk level.\r\n\r\nThe Bottom Line\r\nThere have been numerous government defaults over the past few decades, particularly by countries that borrow in a foreign currency. When default occurs, the government’s bond yields rise precipitously creating a ripple effect throughout the domestic, and often the world, economy.\r\n\r\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\r\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

Increasingly, however, the franchise is also becoming a fount of controversy for the company.\r\n\r\nIn July, Black Widow star Scarlett Johansson sued Disney over its release strategy for the film, claiming that a simultaneous release in theaters and streaming cut into her overall earnings. Now, writers and illustrators who created and wrote the franchise's popular characters are clamoring to renegotiate their copyrights over Marvel characters.\r\n\r\nThey had served the studio with copyright termination notices for popular characters in Marvel's stable—including Black Widow, Captain Marvel, and Falcon—in March. Last week, the company struck back with its own set of suits to invalidate the termination notices.\r\nWork-for-Hire or Freelancers?    \r\nA copyright termination notice ends the exclusive license of an author's copyright in a work or of any right under a copyright. In simple words, this means that creators of best-selling Marvel characters could regain ownership of their work. For Disney, it could mean a return to the negotiating table to redraw licensing contracts with these creators or their estates.\r\n\r\nThe studio contends that the artists wrote the characters under \"work-made-for-hire\" contracts that entitled only them to a flat fee and royalty payments. \"Since these were works made for hire and thus owned by Marvel, we filed these lawsuits to confirm that the termination notices are invalid and of no legal effect,\" Dan Petrocelli, the lawyer representing Disney in this case, told the LA Times in an emailed statement.1 The company's complaint also states that it paid a per-page rate to Lawrence Leiber, creator of the Iron Man series, for his contribution.\r\n\"These guys were all freelancers or independent contractors, working piecemeal for car fare out of their basements,\" Marc Toberoff, who served the copyright termination notices, told The New York Times.2 According to him, the legal interpretation of \"work-made-for-hire\" is \"anachronistic and highly-criticized\" and \"needs to be rectified.\"\r\nBack in 2009, when the heirs of Iron Man creator Jack Kirby sued Disney, the courts ruled in favor of the studio. Kirby's team challenged the ruling and the case was winding its way to the Supreme Court until it was settled by Disney for an undisclosed amount.3\r\n\r\nCan the Case Hurts Disney’s Bottom Line?  \r\nCharacters from the Marvel universe have netted handsome revenues for Disney over the years. But comic book artists, some of who created new storyline arcs from the original cast, have not shared the profits.\r\n\r\nRecent articles have catalogued problems with artist copyrights in the Marvel universe.4 For example, a Guardian piece stated that it was harder to get paid at Marvel for creators. Creator payments for contributions to the Marvel Universe ranged from $5,000 to royalty contracts and producing credits to, in some cases, \"special character contracts\" that allow them to claim a payment whenever their characters are used. But these were not a given and were often shielded in terms outlined in legalese in contracts, according to the piece.5 Media attention on creator contracts may force the studio to rework them on terms more favorable to Marvel writers and illustrators.\r\n\r\nBut it is not likely to make a substantial difference to the studio's revenue from the franchise. The LA Times piece quotes people familiar with the case as saying that even a win for the artists suing Disney would not \"impede\" Disney's use of the characters from the Marvel Universe. An adverse ruling would only force the studio to \"compensate the artists for use of characters from the Marvel Universe.\"\r\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\r\n\r\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

Growth in comparable sales is achieved through an increase in the shopping frequency from new and existing members as well as in the amount they spend per visit.4 When comparable sales are growing, it's a sign that existing sales channels have not yet saturated the local market, nor are those sales being cannibalized by the company's newly opened stores.\r\nCostco's next earnings report (for Q1 FY 2022) is estimated to be released on Dec. 8, 2021.5\r\n\r\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\r\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

(KR) sold off more than 4% on Friday after Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) announced plans to open \"dozens\" of grocery stores in major American cities. The initiative will offer \"products at lower price points\" than wholly owned Whole Foods while cutting into market share at rivals that also include Dow component Walmart Inc. (WMT), Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), Target Corporation (TGT) and Dollar General Corporation (DG).\r\n\r\nKroger stock fell to a two-month low and rebounded into the weekend, with market players squaring positions ahead of Thursday's fourth quarter earnings, when the supermarket chain is expected to report 52 cents in profit on $28.4 billion in revenues. A 3% year-over-year revenue decline and mixed guidance in December's confessional generated a week-long uptick, followed by a swift decline to a six-month low in the mid-$20s.\r\n\r\nAmazon expects to open a Los Angeles store by year end, followed by potential roll-outs in San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Washington DC and Philadelphia. The carefully worded description of expected price points attempted to deflect fears that the initiative will cut into Whole Foods sales, but that store's trendy customers are likely to compare costs despite Amazon's efforts to rope off the new chain.\r\n\r\nThe e-commerce giant also needs to worry about market share with mainstream customers that pay the lowest prices possible to make ends meet. Rivals already fill this demographic to the saturation point, and these folks will be unmoved by lower prices that are still higher than their neighborhood chain or big box store. In addition, Amazon's reputation has been damaged badly in the past year, with a botched headquarters search that has exposed questionable tax breaks and labor practices.\r\n\r\nKroger stock topped out at a split-adjusted $17.45 in 1999 following a multi-year bull run that started at $1.05 in 1989. That marked the highest high for the next 13 years, ahead of a decline that unfolded through two selling waves into a five-year low at $5.50 in 2002. Buyers returned during the mid-decade bull market, lifting the price into resistance at the .786 Fibonacci sell-off retracement level in the mid-teens in 2007.\r\n\r\nA persistent sell-off reached the single digits in 2009 and eased into a basing pattern that held close to the low for more than three years. The stock finally turned higher in 2012, entering a dramatic recovery wave that completed a breakout above the 1999 high in 2013. It posted impressive gains into 2015, topping out at an all-time high at $42.75 in January 2016 and selling off to a three-year low at $20 in 2017. Price action into 2019 has held between the 2015 high and the 2017 low.\r\n\r\nA Fibonacci grid stretched across the downtrend that started in 2015 highlights stubborn resistance at the 50% retracement level in the lower $30s. The stock has failed four attempts to mount that level since February 2017 and has now contracted into a narrow range pattern with support at the closely aligned 50- and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). The .382 retracement of the 2009 into 2015 uptrend cuts through the middle of this pattern, indicating that price action has reached a major inflection point.\r\n\r\nA breakdown through the 50% rally retracement at $26 would set off a preliminary sell signal that increases the odds for a decline into the 2017 low near $20, while a breakout above the 50% sell-off retracement would set the stage for an eventual test at the 2015 high. Daily accumulation-distribution readings posted a two-year high in November 2018 and have drifted lower into March 2019, but this unusually loyal sponsorship tilts the odds in favor of a bullish long-term outcome.\r\n\r\nThe Bottom Line\r\nKroger and other chains that sell groceries lost ground on Friday after Amazon announced a major initiative that could reduce competitor market share and revenues in coming years.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: The author held no positions in aforementioned securities at the time of publication.\r\n\r\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\r\n\r\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

U.S. stocks saw big advances, and both the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 benchmarks briefly hit new all-time highs, exceeding the previous record peaks from August-September of last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other key markets, government bond yields generally rose off their late March lows as strongly positive U.S. economic data boosted the case for more hawkishness from the Federal Reserve than we've been seeing lately.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same dynamics pointing to a stronger economy than previously expected helped continue the push to the upside for the U.S. dollar. In April, the U.S. dollar index hit nearly a two-year high.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, that dollar strength in conjunction with surging equity markets helped to extend the down-move for gold prices. Since its February peak, gold was down nearly 5% as of the end of April.\r\n\r\nFinally, China markets continue to be in focus as the U.S.-China trade deal appears very close to a resolution. The benchmark Shanghai Composite began April with a bang, but fell back sharply towards the end of the month.\r\n\r\nGoing forward into the month of May and beyond, the key macro themes will continue to be U.S. and global economic growth, the Fed's monetary policy trajectory (though there won't be another FOMC meeting until mid-June), U.S. dollar strength and a potential U.S.-China trade deal.\r\n\r\nHere, we bring you our monthly '5 Important Charts to Watch' – markets and instruments that will likely be impacted significantly in May by the factors noted above.\r\n\r\nThe Nasdaq Composite is a major benchmark U.S. index with a heavier weighting towards technology stocks than its other large-cap counterparts. As noted above, the Nasdaq Composite hit a new record high in April around 8176. While the first few days of May saw a pullback for the index, a big rally on May 3rd has almost pared those losses.\r\nOn a longer-term basis, Nasdaq is in a clear and strong uptrend from its late-December lows. The index broke below that trend slightly in the very beginning of May, but should be poised to regain the trendline shortly if the bull run continues.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in April, the Nasdaq formed a 'golden cross', which is a major bullish technical indication that generally occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average.\r\n\r\nWhile we could see a pullback occur in May, momentum is clearly to the upside. If and when the index makes a new all-time high, we could see an acceleration of that upside momentum.\r\n\r\nLate March saw a long-term trough for the U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield that reached as low as 2.34%. Not since December 2017 had this benchmark government bond yield fallen to such a low level.\r\n\r\nIn April, however, yields rose off those lows in part due to strongly positive economic data. With any more upbeat signs for the economy, a Fed interest rate cut may become less of a factor, and yields could continue to rise. During the May 1st FOMC announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to discourage speculation over rate cuts on the horizon.\r\n\r\nIf this continues to be the case, and the economy continues on its path, yields could recover back up towards the 2.80% level. A key wildcard here, however, remains the inflation outlook. With persistently low inflation readings, despite surging economic growth, yields could remain low for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. dollar index is a widely-used gauge of dollar strength that compares the value of the greenback against a basket of currencies, of which the euro occupies the greatest proportion.\r\n\r\nDespite a halt to Fed rate increases that began early this year, the dollar has continued to gain momentum on strengthening U.S. economic data, a falling euro, and other key macro factors. Since early 2018, the dollar index has risen steadily in a sharp bullish trend.\r\n\r\nIf the U.S. economy remains on the upswing, and the Fed refrains from getting too dovish, the dollar index could soon be poised to make a new two-year high above April's 98.30-area highs.\r\n\r\nAs of early May, gold continues to decline in a well-formed downtrend from its February highs. The combination of a rising U.S. dollar and strong equity markets has helped to pressure the precious metal.\r\n\r\nSince gold is typically denominated in U.S. dollars, it is generally inversely correlated with the value of the greenback. And as a safe-haven asset, gold has seen a decrease in safety flows as equity markets show rising risk appetite among investors.\r\n\r\nWith any continuation of these two factors – a rising dollar and rising stocks, gold could see further downside. Currently, the price of gold has descended to a key uptrend line extending back to the August 2018 low. With any breakdown below this line, gold could potentially fall towards its 200-day moving average and the $1240 support area once again.\r\n\r\nThe Shanghai Composite is China's most prominent benchmark equity index. It comprises all stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which is the largest equity exchange in the country.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the Shanghai Composite began April with a bang, but fell back sharply towards the end of the month. As of early May, the index has fallen to hit its 50-day moving average.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. and China currently appear very close to striking a major trade deal. China likely stands to benefit more than the U.S. from such a deal. Therefore, any positive developments in these critical talks could prompt an extended rally for Chinese stocks after the current pullback.\r\n\r\nOverall, the Shanghai Composite continues to trade within an uptrend from the early January lows. Assuming it does not fall far below its 50-day moving average, the index could be poised to recover from the pullback and extend that uptrend to higher highs.\r\n\r\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\r\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.
